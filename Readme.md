Techhouse Backend Provide an api for the interface to handle the project's functions
It's awesome for teaching purposes, sample codes, testing, prototyping.


## Why?

Most of the time when we create a front-end application or website for learning or for client, we have to rely on the backend to implement the front-end or if we want to create a simple learning application we have to use hard-coded data, recently I found myself in need of some data.

I didn't like the idea of using some public API because I had the feeling that I was spending more time registering a client and understanding a complex API than focusing on my task.

So I decided to code a simple backend server that solved my problem, and here's Techhouse.

I hope you will find it useful.
